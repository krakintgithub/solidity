## Introduction
### General overview

This is not a simple pre-sale swap contract. There are several aspects to keep in mind while executing it.

- This contract is a KRK sale contract that allows you to purchase KRK tokens with Ethereum.
- This contract also allows you to get your Ethereum back, with a 4% fee.
- 2% of the fee goes to Krakin't and other 2% is spread to everyone who invested.
- You can earn Ethereum with this contract as well, and cover the 4% fee.
- You can also recover from the 4% loss by using the miner and selling the newly mined tokens on a market.
- You cannot exchange more KRK to Ethereum than you have previously purchased by executing this contract.
- It does not matter where the KRK is coming from, while swapping back to Ethereum, as long as you made a purchase at some point.
- The main purpose of this contract is to encourage trading and mining.
- Every time purchase is made, new KRK tokens are minted. Every time they are swapped back to Ethereum, tokens are burned.
- The contract does not allow more than 5 million tokens to be minted and in circulation at the same time.
- Price of a token increases with the amount of purchases.
- Price of a token decreases when KRK is swapped back to Ethereum.
- Arbitrage with exchanges is possible. 

### Controlled supply vs price

Since Solidity language is limited when it comes to mathematics, instead of using a single curve formula, we are using 10 linear formulas to regulate the price of a token within the frame of this contract. Each line represents a new stage and a steeper slope. There are 10 stages in total. 

To calculate the price, assume:


x = Circulating KRK tokens (that is, generated by the contract)

f(x) = price
 
 
Then, apply these formulas:

stage 1, less than 0.5mil KRK:
- f(x) = 1.9998×10^-7 x + 0.0001

stage 2, greater than 0.5mil KRK, less than 1mil KRK:
- f(x) = 4.22202×10^-7 x - 0.111011

stage 3, greater than 1mil KRK, less than 1.5mil KRK:
- f(x) = 6.72202×10^-7 x - 0.361011

stage 4, greater than 1.5mil KRK, less than 2mil KRK:
- f(x) = 9.57917×10^-7 x - 0.789583

stage 5, greater than 2mil KRK, less than 2.5mil KRK:
- f(x) = 1.29125×10^-6 x - 1.45625

stage 6, greater than 2.5mil KRK, less than 3mil KRK:
- f(x) = 1.69125×10^-6 x - 2.45625

stage 7, greater than 3mil KRK, less than 3.5mil KRK:
- f(x) = 2.19125×10^-6 x - 3.95625

stage 8, greater than 3.5mil KRK, less than 4mil KRK:
- f(x) = 2.85792×10^-6 x - 6.28958
 
stage 9, greater than 4mil KRK, less than 4.5mil KRK:
- f(x) = 3.8579×10^-6 x - 10.2895

stage 10, greater than 4.5mil KRK:
- f(x) = 5.8579×10^-6 x - 19.2895
 

For example, if there were 51000.00 KRK tokens that are circulating and generated by the contract, it means that the price is:

f(x) = 1.9998×10^-7 x + 0.0001 = 0.01029898 (ETH/KRK)

Let us assume that you want to deposit 1.2 Ethereum to a contract. Therefore, we will calculate this as:

- Take away 4% from 1.2 to get 1.152 ETH
- Then calculate the amount of tokens by 1.152 / 0.01029898 = 111.85573717

Now, here is something else to consider.  In order to increase the yield, we multiply 111.85573717 by 1000/(stage number). 
- Therefore, you will get 111855.73717 KRK tokens.

The number of minted tokens by the contract then increases by the 51000 KRK + 111855.73717 KRK, so the next purchase for 1.2 Ethereum gives less tokens.

Please keep in mind, since we are using Solidity and no decimals (just big integers), the price is always going to be the best estimate lacking a certain precision while transforming everything to big integers that include 18 decimals in calculation. This is a reason why the contract line formulas and the ones presented in this document are different. Nevertheless, they represent the same numbers and logic.
