Quick road-map


1. Make sure that the token works only for the conctracts that were meant for a token and that no external contracts or hacking attempts will break it.

3. See whether the Ropsten version can be released on exchanges to test whether the token can work with them (Uniswap for example, relays etc)

4. When all is passed, release the token with a very small amount that can be exchanged with the buttcoin.

5. Create the buttcoin exchange contract, try not to make it a ponzi scheme :-)
